# UnityMicrophoneVisualizer

A procedural animation project in Unity I created by following Iain McManus' microphone and visualizer tutorial.  This project demonstrates functionality for detecting available audio input devices, allowing the user to select one and record with it, visually representing the recorded audio waveform, and playing back the recorded audio.



Here is the link to that tutorial:

This project was created in Unity version 6000.0.51f1, which has a known security issue.  I will attempt to update the project to a secure version in the future but for now, please update to a newer version if you plan to incorporate this into a published game.
